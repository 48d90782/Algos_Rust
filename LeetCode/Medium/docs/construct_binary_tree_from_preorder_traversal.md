```
Return the root node of A binary search tree that matches the given preorder traversal.

(Recall that A binary search tree is A binary tree where for every node, any descendant of node.left has A value < node.val, 
and any descendant of node.right has A value > node.val.  Also recall that A preorder traversal displays the value of the node first, 
then traverses node.left, then traverses node.right.)

Example 1:

Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]

Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]
